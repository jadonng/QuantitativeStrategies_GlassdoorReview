       "2  When a management team just keeps promoting within itself due to just being best friends outside of work (Fraternization) it can lead to some problems that were unforseen but rather the upper management team will ignore. When a manager gets to tell you that work matters more than your family in the Emergency Room or the deaths of family members. This is also when the lower management gets free reign to do whatever they want, such as making their own company policies and using favoritism to restrict the work-flow specific employees to force them to leave the company, rather than giving them the tools to success. Management needs to be reviewed, and I still have all the hard-copy proof in relation to this.   \n",
